## Ubuntu (2 years) -> Debian

At some point, I felt proficient enough with Ubuntu. Since it‚Äôs a fork of Debian, I read somewhere that Ubuntu users just ‚Äòeat what‚Äôs served,‚Äô while Debian users need to take a few extra steps. I was up for that challenge as a way to sharpen my skills. I had no idea what my future job would be, but given that many servers run on Debian, having that experience under my belt felt like a huge win. Besides, I was young then. Young people often want to stand out, and Ubuntu just felt too common.

## Debian (6 years) -> Fedora

They said `dnf` was better than `apt`, and Fedora always seemed to ship the newest shiny things before anyone else. Btrfs, ZRAM, Wayland-only, and so on. So I took the plunge and migrated both of my machines. If I remember correctly, it also had something to do with Steam. It worked fine on Debian, but I recall that installing Nvidia drivers for my laptop‚Äôs graphics card was easier at the time on Fedora.

Why not after 6-7 years with Debian?

### Debian I3 -> BSPWM

In 2021, I landed a job, and I have to manage both my personal laptop and office laptop. The static nature of the i3 configuration forces me to use multiple branches for my dotfiles.
Hence, in 2022 I migrated to a WM that has a dynamic configuration.

## Fedora (9 months) -> Fedora Silverblue

I accidentally removed one of NetworkManager‚Äôs dependencies, which made the OS useless since it couldn‚Äôt connect to Wi-Fi.
I managed to fix it by plugging in a spare Ethernet cable through my little Huawei portable router.
But after that, I decided to switch to an atomic/immutable distro to avoid running into the same problem in the future.

## Fedora Silverblue (11 days) -> Debian

My company uses F5 for authentication, and it‚Äôs a pain to get it working on an immutable OS.
It requires a writes to `/usr`.
On top of that, I somehow can‚Äôt flash my QMK keyboard anymore, though I still need to investigate further.
In the end, I decided I need a mutable OS with Flatpak and AppImages so I can minimize touching the underlying system.
This week, with RHEL going closed-source and Fedora planning to introduce telemetry, my decision to switch only grew stronger.

## Debian (19 days) -> Fedora

Setting up LUKS/LVM in the Fedora installer was a breeze,
but on Debian I had to endure the pain of manual partitioning with lots of CLI commands.
I told myself it was fine, something you only do once in a lifetime.

The disappointment grew when I saw Debian shipping with an older GNOME desktop,
while I‚Äôd already been enjoying newer versions on Fedora. But the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back was the ugly,
bare-bones prompt Debian uses to decrypt the hard disk. Compared to Fedora‚Äôs polished one, it felt awful.
Honestly, that alone was 90% of the reason I switched back.

For me, Fedora just feels more polished and focused on desktop users.

## Fedora (2 years) -> Debian

I‚Äôm happy with Fedora. latest packages, shiny kernel, cutting-edge GNOME.
Unlike Debian, I don‚Äôt need to grab or compile binaries, the repos are always catching up with upstream.

Sadly, there was a time when a system update broke my Ghostty terminal, a kernel bug.
Also, It froze occasionally, and GNOME logged me out for no reason.

I never had issues like that in my ~6 years with Debian.
I guess I‚Äôm okay with that ugly LUKS password prompt in Debian ü§∑üèº.

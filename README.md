I have been using Debian since 2017 until 2021. Throughout that time, I have been using the [i3 window manager][debian-i3], specifically from 2017 to 2019.

In 2021, I landed a job, and I have to manage both my personal laptop and office laptop. The static nature of the i3 configuration forces me to use multiple branches for my dotfiles. Hence, in 2022 I migrated to a WM that has a dynamic configuration, [bspwm][debian-bspwm].

After watching some YouTube videos that praise Fedora, I took my plunge and reinstalled both of them to [Fedora Workstation][fedora-gnome] in 2023.

Several months passed and I break it. I migrate to [Fedora Silverblue][fedora-silverblue] for obvious reasons. Turns out I can't flash my custom keyboard using a containerized environment. At the same time, my office requires me to install an app that writes to `/usr`.

Last week, RedHat goes "closed source" and Fedora attempted to have a telemetry for its user. I go back to where I am from, [Debian][current-os].

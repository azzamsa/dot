## Uh Oh! Where is Your Old Configuration?

tl;dr

- Ubuntu, 2013 - 2017
- [Debian][debian-i3], 2017 - 2023
- [Fedora Workstation][fedora-gnome], 2023.
- [Fedora Silverblue][fedora-silverblue], 2023.
- [Debian][current-os], 2023.
- [Fedora Workstation][current-os], 2023.
- [cargo-scripts][cargo-scripts].

I have been using Debian since 2017 until 2021. Throughout that time, I have been using the [i3 window manager][debian-i3], specifically from 2017 to 2019.

In 2021, I landed a job, and I have to manage both my personal laptop and office laptop. The static nature of the i3 configuration forces me to use multiple branches for my dotfiles. Hence, in 2022 I migrated to a WM that has a dynamic configuration, [bspwm][debian-bspwm].

After watching some YouTube videos that praise Fedora, I took my plunge and reinstalled both of them to [Fedora Workstation][fedora-gnome] in 2023.

Several months passed and I break it. I migrate to [Fedora Silverblue][fedora-silverblue] for obvious reasons. Turns out I can't flash my custom keyboard using a containerized environment. At the same time, my office requires me to install an app that writes to `/usr`.

Last week, RedHat goes "closed source" and Fedora attempted to have a telemetry for its user. I go back to where I am from, [Debian][debian-gnome].

Unfortunately, I haven't come across any Linux distribution that offers a desktop experience as polished as [Fedora][current-os].

## Contribution

I won't be accepting any functionality or behavior changes. But it is OK for fixes and refinement.
I don't recommend using this repository directly. Instead, use it as a source of inspiration.

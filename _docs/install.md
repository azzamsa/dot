# Installation Guide

The steps I need to install Debian GNU/Linux on my machine.

## Current Machine

- Debian + GNOME

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Migration

Look for what to backup in your notes. See "What To Backup?".

## Preparing The ISO image

Go to the distro‚Äôs website and download the **GNOME-flavored LIVE ISO**, then copy it to your Ventoy USB stick.
Make sure you grab the **LIVE ISO**, as the Calamares installer is only available there.

Whenever possible, use the provided _torrent_ file to reduce load on the server. Wait until the copying process is **fully** finished.
Otherwise, the file may end up corrupted. After that, verify the checksum:

```shell
sha256sum -c CHECKSUM
```

Copy the ISO using Ventoy. If you run into issues even after verifying the checksum, try another flashing tool such as `Fedora Media Writer` or `BalenaEtcher`.

## Installation

Always preview and double-check the password during installation. You don‚Äôt want to repeat the entire process just because of a typo.

Enable encrypted volumes (LUKS). Don‚Äôt make life harder by using manual partitioning.
Just go with guided mode and use the full Samsung 250 GB disk. I dedicate a separate disk for installation.
Even though I could split off `/home`, I always make sure to back everything up before reinstalling.
By doing this, I don‚Äôt have to worry about accidentally wiping important files.
I also use symlinks to my larger SSD so applications still see everything under `~/` instead of `/media/user/...`.

Stick with the defaults for everything, including locales, to avoid running into edge cases. You can always change the locale later in GNOME settings.

## Setting Up Shell Prompt

‚ö†Ô∏è Copy important files to new machine `~/dot`, `~/.local/share/atuin/`, `~/.local/share/fonts`, etc.
See "What To Backup?" note.

```bash
./init.sh

./prompt.sh
```

## Setup GNOME Extensions

I need this early to have smooth access to brightness control and clipboard.
üí° Flatpak apps won‚Äôt appear in the desktop menu until after a restart.

Copy backup to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.

```bash
./flatpak.sh
```

## Install Apps

üí° I don't want to pollute my base system. Using Flatpak, I can freely remove applications without worrying my system will be broken.

I think I will just use mutable OS an immutable way!

‚ö†Ô∏è Copy `eget` and `ya (yazi)` to `~/.local/bin`.

```bash
./packages.sh
```

- https://yaak.app/download

## Setup Apps

### Atuin

```bash
atuin login
atuin sync
```

### Discord / Vestop

Change the default chat scale.
Then zoom using `Ctrl +`

### Firefox

Copy the content from previous machine to `/ect/host` to be able to access certain websites.
Change the default scale to 130%.

### Flameshot

```bash
# Check if it's working as intended.
flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot gui
```

Disable `Show Tray Icon`.

### KeePassXC

Increase the default value of "clear clipboard after" in KeepassXC

### Pano

Enable `Sync to Primary clipboard`.
Increase history limit to `400`.
Disable `Keep search entry`.

## Setting Up DNS

On laptop.

- `Setting` -> `Wifi` -> `DNS`
  - IPv4: `1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1`
  - IPv6: `2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001`

## Setup GNOME

### Tweaks

Fonts:

- Interface Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Document Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Monospace Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Hinting : Slight
- Antialiasing: Standard (greyscale)
- Scaling Factor: 1.00

Appearance:

- Cursor: Bibata-Modern-Classic

Startup Applications:

- You know what to add!

Top Bar:

- Only show hour

### Locale

Set time, paper size, and units in British.

Go to `Settings` -> `Region and Languages`. Set format to `United Kingdom`.

### Date & Time

`Settings` -> `Date & Time`.

Enable `Automatic Time Zone`.
Set `Time Format` to `AM/PM`.

### Shortcut / Keymap

Go to `Settings` -> `Keyboard`.

Custom shortcut:

- Flameshot
  - name: `Flameshot`
  - command: `bash -c "flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot gui --raw | wl-copy"`
  - shortcut: `PrtScn`
- Flameshot Screen
  - name: `Flameshot`
  - command: `flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot screen`
  - shortcut: `Shitf + PrtScn`

Navigations:

Using numbers feels slower and less comfortable given the size of my keyboard

```
Switch to workspace 1    Super+X
Switch to workspace 2    Super+C
Switch to workspace 3    Super+D
Switch to workspace 4    Super+A
```

Alt-Tab per Workspace:

```
Switch Windows           Alt+TAB
Switch Applications      Disabled
```

For more, see [keymaps.conf](https://github.com/azzamsa/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/hypr/keymaps.conf)

### Multitasking

- Workspace: Fixed number. 4 workspaces.
- Application switching: include only applications from the current workspace.
- Multi-monitor: workspace on primary display only.

To prevent Apps to move to the Laptop monitor during suspension, go to `Display` and set it to `Mirror`.

### Startup

- Emacs
- VeskTop
- Ghostty
- Zen Browser
- SilverBullet
- Sane Break

### Text Editor

- Disable "Restore session"

## Clean Up

Remove bloatware.

```bash
out rhythmbox xiterm+thai goldendict-ng hdate-applet fcitx5 mozc-utils-gui firefox-esr
sudo nala autoremove && sudo nala autopurge
```

## Setup Hardware

### Bluetooth

- Orbit trackball: press the DPI button 3s to enter the pair mode.
- VXE: press the all tree buttons 3s to enter the pair mode.
- Soundcore V20i: it activates pair mode automatically everytime it went out of it case.
- JBL Go: press the pair button.

## Setup Power Management

‚ö†Ô∏è Skip this step if you are on PC.

```bash
out power-profiles-daemon
```

```bash
in tlp tlp-rdw

sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket
```

Configure `/etc/tlp.conf`.

```diff
-STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0=60
+STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0="1"
```

Start `TLP`.

```bash
sudo tlp start
sudo tlp-stat -s -c -b
```

## Setting Up Docker

[Debian | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#uninstall-old-versions)

The version on official repo is too old.

## Finish üéâ

Go to `opt/pbin` and run `post_install.sh`

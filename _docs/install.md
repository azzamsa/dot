# Installation Guide

The steps I need to install Debian GNU/Linux on my machine.

## Current Machine

- Debian + GNOME

## Preparing The ISO image

Go to the distro‚Äôs website and download the **GNOME-flavored LIVE ISO**, then copy it to your Ventoy USB stick.
Make sure you grab the **LIVE ISO**, as the Calamares installer is only available there.

Whenever possible, use the provided _torrent_ file to reduce load on the server. Wait until the copying process is **fully** finished.
Otherwise, the file may end up corrupted. After that, verify the checksum:

```shell
sha256sum -c CHECKSUM
```

Copy the ISO using Ventoy. If you run into issues even after verifying the checksum, try another flashing tool such as `Fedora Media Writer` or `BalenaEtcher`.

## Installation

Always preview and double-check the password during installation. You don‚Äôt want to repeat the entire process just because of a typo.

Enable encrypted volumes (LUKS). Don‚Äôt make life harder by using manual partitioning.
Just go with guided mode and use the full Samsung 250 GB disk. I dedicate a separate disk for installation.
Even though I could split off `/home`, I always make sure to back everything up before reinstalling.
By doing this, I don‚Äôt have to worry about accidentally wiping important files.
I also use symlinks to my larger SSD so applications still see everything under `~/` instead of `/media/user/...`.

Stick with the defaults for everything, including locales, to avoid running into edge cases. You can always change the locale later in GNOME settings.

## Setting Up Shell Prompt

‚ö†Ô∏è  Copy important files to new machine `~/dot`, `~/.local/share/atuin/`, `~/.local/share/fonts`.
Later, you need to move more directory, See `~/.config/meta/backup.include`

```bash
./init.sh

./prompt.sh
```

## Setup GNOME Extensions

I need this early to have smooth access to brightness control and clipboard.
üìª Flatpak apps won‚Äôt appear in the desktop menu until after a restart.

Copy backup to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.

```bash
./flatpak.sh
```

## Install Apps

üí° I don't want to pollute my base system. Using Flatpak, I can freely remove applications without worrying my system will be broken.

I think I will just use mutable OS an immutable way!

‚ö†Ô∏è Copy `eget` and `ya (yazi)`  to `~/.local/bin`.

```bash
./packages.sh
```

Binaries:

```bash
# need explicit destination.
eget idursun/jjui --to ~/.local/bin/jjui

eget getzola/zola
```

AppImages:

- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/releases
- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases
- https://yaak.app/download

## Setup Apps

### Yazi

```bash
# This get both `ya` and `yazi `
eget sxyazi/yazi
ya pkg add yazi-rs/flavors:catppuccin-mocha

# remove the duplicate `yazi`
rm ~/.local/bin/yazi
```

### Atuin

```bash
atuin login
atuin sync
```

### Emacs

```bash
git clone git@github.com:azzamsa/camp.d.git ~/.config/emacs

# Those files are unnecessary and occasionally cause me to misclick.
sudo rm -f \
  /usr/share/applications/emacs-term.desktop \
  /usr/share/applications/emacs-mail.desktop \
  /usr/share/applications/emacsclient-mail.desktop \
  /usr/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop
```

### Neovim

```bash
cin toor

git clone git@github.com:azzamsa/roof.git ~/.config/nvim
eget neovide/neovide --to ~/.local/bin/neovide --asset "neovide.AppImage"
```

### Helix

The flatpak version depends on huge `org.freedesktop.Sdk` library.
Use the binary instead.

Take the `helix-<version>-x86_64-linux.tar.xz` from the [release](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases) page.
Unpack, then put `hx` in `~/.local/bin`, `hx.fish` in `~/.config/fish/completions/`, and `runtime` in `~/.config/helix`

### Fish

```bash
atuin gen-completions --shell fish --out-dir ~/.config/fish/completions/
just --completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/just.fish
rg --generate complete-fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rg.fish
```

### Discord / Vestop

Change the default chat scale.
Then zoom using `Ctrl +`

### Firefox

Copy the content from previous machine to `/ect/host` to be able to access certain websites.
Change the default scale to 130%.

### Flameshot

```bash
# allow Flatpak Flameshot to take screenshots
flatpak permission-set screenshot screenshot org.flameshot.Flameshot yes

# Check if it's working as intended.
flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot gui
```

Disable `Show Tray Icon`.

### KeePassXC

Increase the default value of "clear clipboard after" in KeepassXC

### Pano

Enable `Sync to Primary clipboard`.
Increase history limit to `400`.
Disable `Keep search entry`.

## Setting Up DNS

On laptop.

- `Setting` -> `Wifi` -> `DNS`
  - IPv4: `1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1`
  - IPv6: `2606:4700:4700::1111,2606:4700:4700::1001`

## Setup GNOME

### Tweaks

Fonts:

- Interface Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Document Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Monospace Text: "Maple Mono NF 13"
- Hinting : Slight
- Antialiasing: Standard (greyscale)
- Scaling Factor: 1.00

Appearance:

- Cursor: Bibata-Modern-Classic

Startup Applications:

- You know what to add!

Top Bar:

- Only show hour

### Locale

Set time, paper size, and units in British.

Go to `Settings` -> `Region and Languages`. Set format to `United Kingdom`.

### Date & Time

`Settings` -> `Date & Time`.

Enable `Automatic Time Zone`.
Set `Time Format` to `AM/PM`.

### Shortcut / Keymap

Go to `Settings` -> `Keyboard`.

Custom shortcut:

- Flameshot
  - name: `Flameshot`
  - command: `bash -c "flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot gui --raw | wl-copy"`
  - shortcut: `PrtScn`
- Flameshot Screen
  - name: `Flameshot`
  - command: `flatpak run --command=flameshot org.flameshot.Flameshot screen`
  - shortcut: `Shitf + PrtScn`

Navigations:

Using numbers feels slower and less comfortable given the size of my keyboard

```
Switch to workspace 1    Super+X
Switch to workspace 2    Super+C
Switch to workspace 3    Super+D
Switch to workspace 4    Super+A
```

Alt-Tab per Workspace:

```
Switch Windows           Alt+TAB
Switch Applications      Disabled
```

For more, see [keymaps.conf](https://github.com/azzamsa/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/hypr/keymaps.conf)

### Multitasking

- Workspace: Fixed number. 4 workspaces.
- Application switching: include only applications from the current workspace.
- Multi-monitor: workspace on primary display only.

To prevent Apps to move to the Laptop monitor during suspension, go to `Display` and set it to `Mirror`.

### Startup

- VeskTop
- Ghostty
- Zen Browser
- SilverBullet
- Sane Break

### Text Editor

- Disable "Restore session"

```

```bash
in tlp tlp-rdw

sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
sudo systemctl mask systemd-rfkill.service systemd-rfkill.socket
```

Configure `/etc/tlp.conf`.

```bash
sudo tlp start
sudo tlp-stat -s -c -b
```

## Setting Up Docker

[Debian | Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#uninstall-old-versions)

The version on official repo is too old.
